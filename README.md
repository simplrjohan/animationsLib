## WIP
This is a very basic implementation of Lottie animations and Framer Motion to evaluate its feasibility and ease of use. Any feedback or suggestions is appreciated. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

###### `Npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Lottie

###### Lottie-Web
https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web
Use Adobe After effects for animation -> Download as a JSON file, Gif, MP$-> Use in SVG format

###### Interactions

###### Lottie Animations Inspo

###### Issues
No-support for react-lottie

### Framer Motion

###### Development First

Widget interaction examples using Framer for react to see it’s feasibility and ease of development. 
More info: https://www.framer.com/developers/
it has support for server-side rendering, gestures, and CSS variables.



###### Components

There's a motion component for every HTML and SVG element, for instance motion.div, motion.circle etc.

###### Handshake is on Beta

### Alternatives:

 
- React-Motion is an animation library that takes an easier approach to create and implement realistic animations. React-Motion makes use of physics in order to create an almost natural animation for React elements.https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-motion

- React-spring is a modern animation library that is based on spring physics. It’s highly flexible and covers most animations needed for a user interface. react-spring inherits some properties from React Motion, such as ease of use, interpolation, and performance.
